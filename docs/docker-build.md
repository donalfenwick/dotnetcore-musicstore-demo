# Build with dotnet cli  
Follow the instructions below to build the application with docker.  
Note: This requires that you first have docker installed on your OS.

**Step 1:**
If running docker on windows, first switch docker to use linux containers.  

**Step 2:**
Execute the `docker-compose build` from the repository root.   
This will build all of the docker images required for running the applications.
This step may take some time as it will download the base images for building the application.

**Step 3:**
Execute the `docker-compose up` from the repository root. 
This will start up each of the docker containers built in the last step. 

**Step 4:**
Navigate to the running application in your browser.  
  
Applications will be avaiable under the following url's..
frontend - `http://localhost:5600/`
admin app - `http://localhost:5604/`
identity server - `http://localhost:5601/`
oauth test - `http://localhost:5607/` (test implementation of a server side implicit grant login with IdentityServer4)
